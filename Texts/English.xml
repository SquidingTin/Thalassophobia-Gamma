	<faction.thal_confederacy>The Europan Confederacy</faction.thal_confederacy>
	<faction.thal_confederacy.description>The Europan Confederacy is a more moral offshoot of the notorious Jovian Seperatists. After the great recession, various outposts confederated together to advocate for increased freedoms, which caused the Coalition to declare war. The Jovian Seperatists and Confederacy disagree on their methods: \nWhile the Jovian Seperatists will resort to terrorism to combat the Coalition, the Confederacy generally tries to harm fewer innocents.</faction.thal_confederacy.description>
	<faction.thal_confederacy.shortdescription>League of Seperatist outposts that formally declared secession from the Coalition, who branded them traitors. Firm believers in individual rights, they fight in a direct war unlike the insurgent Jovian Seperatists.</faction.thal_confederacy.shortdescription>

	<faction.thal_cartel>Chthonian Cartel</faction.thal_cartel>
	<faction.thal_cartel.description>The Chthonian Cartel is the face of Europa's sprawling criminal underworld. It is unknown if "Chthonian" refers to the Lovecraftian monsters under the ice or the 'underworld' from which the cartel originates. In some areas with limited Coalition presence, the cartel acts as an authority.</faction.thal_cartel.description>

	<jobname.thal_clown>Clown</jobname.thal_clown>
	<jobdescription.thal_clown>Clowns are the comical oddballs employed to entertain the crew. Their job is not necessarily to aid the ship, but rather to alleviate the crew's boredom through harmless antics and pranks. They have a "tomfoolery" stat that determines their effectiveness with various antics. If your games are becoming dull on the social side, consider adding one of the clown variants.</jobdescription.thal_clown>

	<jobname.thal_cultist>Cultist</jobname.thal_cultist>
	<jobdescription.thal_cultist>A religious group that seeks "communion" with the husk parasite in order to usher in a new kind of humanity, one more capable of surviving in this harsh environment.</jobdescription.thal_cultist>

	<jobname.thal_clown2>Honkchild</jobname.thal_clown2>
	<jobname.thal_clown3>Mime</jobname.thal_clown3>
	<jobdescription.thal_clown1>The jester is the classic performer, always scheming. They spawn with basic clowning gear as well as a fabricator that allows them to make a variety of hysterical pranking gear from odds and ends they find around the ship. Notably, they are quite skilled with balloons and can make surprisingly functional balloon sculptures.</jobdescription.thal_clown1>
	<jobdescription.thal_clown2>Honkchildren, part cultist and part shaman, are the cunning followers of the Children of the Honkmother. Sworn in under the Honkly Juggaloath, they are loyal devotees to the honkmother.\nIf spirit rituals, blood pacts, and creature summoning sound fun, choose this.</jobdescription.thal_clown2>
	<jobdescription.thal_clown3>Mimes are unable to speak but possess various superpowers that make them faster, sturdier, stronger, and capable of affecting/irritating other players.</jobdescription.thal_clown3>

	<jobname.thal_scientist>Scientist</jobname.thal_scientist>
	<jobdescription.thal_scientist>Scientists are the class for eager experimenters and researchers who want to uncover the secrets of Europa. Grow deadly but profitable fauna, create reactive gases, research and splice DNA, assemble lightsabers, perform surgery, and much more.</jobdescription.thal_scientist>
	<jobname.thal_scientist1>Botanist</jobname.thal_scientist1>
	<jobname.thal_scientist2>Geneticist</jobname.thal_scientist2>
	<jobdescription.thal_scientist1>Botanists may sound boring, but Europa houses many botanic horrors. Plants can range from highly corrosive to massively infectious, occasionally even bringing back the dead. This job requires you to strap on your respirator to create and maintain highly toxic environments to get rich quick.</jobdescription.thal_scientist1>
	<jobdescription.thal_scientist2>For those with a god complex, Geneticists allow you to toy with your subjects on a genetic level. Imprison monsters and scan them for their DNA, which can then be used to hatch more of them, upgrade your weaponry against them, or even graft their DNA with your crewmates to steal their abilities.</jobdescription.thal_scientist2>
	
	<jobname.thal_enforcer>Enforcer</jobname.thal_enforcer>
	<jobdescription.thal_enforcer>Enforcers are responsible for keeping the submarine safe from threats, both external and internal. The creatures inhabiting the ocean aren't the only threat they need to worry about, as several of the renegade groups opposing the Europa Coalition are known to have sent infiltrators on board the vessels.</jobdescription.thal_enforcer>

			<!-- Leaky reactor -->

	<!-- Player interaction with the reactor -->
	<thal_reactorleak.interaction>You pause for a moment in front of the reactor. A shrill hissing noise emanates from somewhere behind the fission gauge, but you can't pinpoint the exact location. Investigating further would require some experience with the mechanical parts of a fission reactor. Having a wrench would probably help too.</thal_reactorleak.interaction>

	<!-- Success in fixing the reactor with a wrench: leaky reactor at 50% condition, Reputation +30, requires Mechanical skill success -->
	<thal_reactorleak.fix_success_mechanical_success>Using your wrench, you unbolt the panel. With the interface out of the way, the problem becomes evident: One of the coolant pipes is loose, and the reactor is beginning to overheat. You tighten the pipe, crisis averted! You've just done the outpost a huge favor.</thal_reactorleak.fix_success_mechanical_success>

	<!-- Alternative fix without a wrench: leaky reactor at 30% condition, Reputation +15, requires Mechanical skill success -->
	<thal_reactorleak.fix_alternative_mechanical_success>Without a wrench on hand, you'll need to devise a different solution. Reaching under a grate, you feel something loose. You snap it back into position, and the hissing stops for now. It might be a makeshift fix, but it has definitely helped the outpost.</thal_reactorleak.fix_alternative_mechanical_success>

	<!-- Partial fix with a wrench but player gets burned: leaky reactor at 30% condition, burn on LeftHand, Reputation +30, requires Mechanical skill failure -->
	<thal_reactorleak.fix_partial_mechanical_failure>You're not exactly a mechanical genius, but hey, you do have a wrench. poking around, you notice some bolts on the display, so you start with those. Once the panel is off, you tighten an adjoining bolt that appears to have come loose, but you quickly recoil when you accidentally burn yourself on a hot piece of metal! Regardless, you think you may have just done well by the outpost, and may have learned a thing or two about reactors.</thal_reactorleak.fix_partial_mechanical_failure>

	<!-- Failure to fix without a wrench: leaky reactor at 20% condition, radiation sickness on LeftHand, Reputation +8, requires Mechanical skill failure -->
	<thal_reactorleak.fix_failure_mechanical_failure>You have no idea what you're doing, and to make matters worse, you lack a wrench. Feeling around under a grate, you clumsily bump into something. The hissing stops, but your hand feels odd. It's probably wise to consult a doctor.</thal_reactorleak.fix_failure_mechanical_failure>

	<thalcampaign_uesdonation.fewmarks>They continue: “We mostly fight poverty by managing soup kitchens, clothing drives, or doing community service like cleaning up the outposts hit hard by the crash.“ They present the donation box: “Just a few marks can make a world of difference!“</thalcampaign_uesdonation.fewmarks>
	<thalcampaign_uesdonation.goingaround>“And you're going around with that thing asking for donations?“</thalcampaign_uesdonation.goingaround>

	<thalcampaign_uesdonation.irked>The UES member is clearly irked by your remark: “We oppose the conflict between the coalition and the separatist forces, if that's what you mean. It's our belief the 'war on terrorism' has done nothing but make a lot of marks for weapon manufacturers, all at the cost of the common people. There was never a 'good war' or a 'bad peace'. Regardless, none of our fundraising is spent politically. We just want to ease suffering.“</thalcampaign_uesdonation.irked>

	<thalcampaign_uesdonation.political>“So you're backed by the Coalition, or what?“</thalcampaign_uesdonation.political>
	<thalcampaign_uesdonation.humanity>The UES member gives a sidelong look: “We're not really 'with' anyone. The UES is friends to humanity itself. Is it really so bad that we're not power-tripping oligarchs, murderous separatists, parasite-worshipping cultists, or psycho clowns? Some people say that unlike the other guys, our pacifist ideals aren't achievable on the hellscape that is Europa. I guess after this fundraising campaign, we'll see how many people are willing to believe.“</thalcampaign_uesdonation.humanity>

I've been penned in this middle-of-nowhere outpost on fundraising duty until... pretty much the end of time, so I don't have the paperwork on me. I'll forward your request to higher-ups though, and we'll see if someone can contact you further into your travels at a different outpost, okay?“</thalcampaign_uesdonation.membership>

		<!-- MIME PERFORMANCE -->
	<thalcampaign_mimeperformance.start>There's a street mime here. These professional entertainers engage in what many believe to be more sophisticated acts of tomfoolery. While clowns engage in crass, lowbrow humor, mimes are naturally drawn to better-bred antics, making them more accepted in many outposts, regardless of creed.</thalcampaign_mimeperformance.start>
	<thalcampaign_mimeperformance.grin>The mime swivels around and sees you. They exaggeratedly lean forward to peer at you, hand shielding their eyes from an imaginary sun. A moment later, their pale face breaks into a big, checkered grin. Your crew's reputation precedes you among many European entertainers, and this one seems to have heard good things about the whole lot.</thalcampaign_mimeperformance.grin>

	-Aiming the M60 requires holding still.
	-After firing a shot, there are 15 seconds of unlimited fire, followed by a 30 second cooldown where the gun is unusable. Plan for a retreat or bring a secondary weapon.
	-Enemies are not stunlocked when hit, only slowed, and can potentially escape or rush you. Bloodloss is minimal. Plan accordingly.

	<thal_guidegen_scannerlabel>SCANNING</thal_guidegen_scannerlabel>
	<entityname.thal_guidegen_scanner>@SCANNING\n\nEvery geneticist starts with a scanner to obtain DNA by scanning creatures. DNA is the backbone of genetics.\nYou can hold right mouse button to aim, and press E or Left-Mouse to attach your scanner to a wall. Attached, you can interact with the scanner to turn it on and off. The emitted beam is hazardous and will have slow but deadly effects on people around it left on for too long. It will also break down quickly while active, so use sparingly. To detach the scanner, use a wrench. You can also wire the scanner in order to operate remotely with signals.\nTo obtain DNA, a *LIVING* creature must stand under the beam of a scanner for ~30 seconds. The progress of the scan can be seen on the scanner in the form of a progress bar that gradually fills during scanning. If a creature exits the beam, the bar will deplete quickly: maintain its position by any means necessary.\nThe Institute recommends that scientists use Paralyzant in order to keep the creature alive but motionless. Robust scientists, however, have been known to use other tricks to avoid wasting Paralyzant. Remember that safety of the crew comes first!\nOnce the bar is full, a fresh fragment of DNA will drop out of the scanner. Put it in your cooler ASAP.</entityname.thal_guidegen_scanner>
	<thal_guidegen_dnalabel>DNA HANDLING</thal_guidegen_dnalabel>
	<entityname.thal_guidegen_dna>@DNA HANDLING\n\nDNA is a delicate, valuable resource. It is naturally scarce (unless it comes with your submarine), and is difficult to obtain as it requires scanning. Most importantly, DNA erodes when not submerged in water, or when not in special cold storage containers, like your DNA Cooler. Damage/Erosion is irreversable; The condition of DNA can only ever worsen. Given long enough, all DNA will ineviteably erode completely, no matter how careful you are. But how quickly and cleanly you use it determines its longevity.\nDNA that has eroded completely will become corrupted. Corrupted DNA behaves erratically, and involuntary usage on subjects is considered unethical malpractice. Despite this, experimenting on willing test subjects is encouraged as many of its side effects are potentially beneficial for human survival on Europa, and may aid your crew.</entityname.thal_guidegen_dna>
	<thal_guidegen_splicelabel>SPLICING</thal_guidegen_splicelabel>
	<entityname.thal_guidegen_splice>@SPLICING\n\nDNA can be spliced with the DNA of you or your crewmembers to gain new abilities.\nDNA can be grafted to three types of target slots: The "Head", the "Torso", and the "Limbs". Each graft has a different effect depending on the slot and the DNA used. Each slot can only have one mutation; Splicing to a slot will revert any existing grafts there.\nAnything grafted to the head slot is an active ability, meaning you can press "Creature Attack" (middle mouse by default) to use it.\nCRISPR-Cas9 is an intracellular solution that prepares the subject's DNA for grafts. It is consumed in one use, making it precious, and equivalent to one graft in worth.\nTo use CRISPR, equip it. The Health menu must be closed, or it won't equip. You will see three buttons onscreen. Click one depending on your desired slot. Inject it into whoever you want spliced. They will now enter "meltdown": they are ready for the graft.\nNext, put your DNA in the DNA Grafter. Be quick to minimize DNA corruption. Inject the grafter into the person undergoing meltdown. They should collapse and get up shortly with a new ability. Congrats!\nWhen humans with grafts die, their DNA collapses and they melt. Revival, organ harvesting, and other things dependent on corpses won't work.</entityname.thal_guidegen_splice>
	<thal_guidegen_graftslabel>KNOWN GRAFTS</thal_guidegen_graftslabel>
	<entityname.thal_guidegen_grafts>@KNOWN GRAFTS\n\nBelow is a list of known grafts discovered by The Institute so far. You can see all 3 slot grafts of a DNA and what they do in the DNA sample's mouseover description. It's up to Europan geneticists to find the rest!\n\nMUDRAPTOR-LIMBS\nTail that increases swim speed.\nCRAWLER-TORSO\nGills that provide air in water.\nMUSHROOM-TORSO\nPores that regenerate health in spore clouds.\nMAGGOT-HEAD\nLaunches user at a structure/entity on use.\nTHRESHER-TORSO\nShell immune to pressure up to 4000m.\nHAMMERHEAD-HEAD\nHead ridge that sends other creatures flying.\n\nCan YOU research all 21 grafts? Better get scanning!</entityname.thal_guidegen_grafts>
	<thal_guidegen_mutationlabel>MUTATIONS</thal_guidegen_mutationlabel>
	<entityname.thal_guidegen_mutation>@MUTATIONS\n\nMUTATIONS are a side effect of genetic malpractice. The Institute strongly discourages the use of mutations on the general public but encourages controlled research on test subjects to study and catalogue mutations. There are 30 mutations in all.\nWhen CORRUPT DNA is grafted, a random number of mutations (anywhere from 1-7) may emerge in the patient alongside the usual graft. Mutations consist of two types: DISORDERS and MutationS. DISORDERS are mostly harmful, while MutationS are beneficial. Disorders are indicated by a FUCHSIA PINK icon where afflictions are normally shown, and Mutations are indicated by a YELLOW-GREEN. The specific mutations you get from corrupted DNA are essentially luck: Initially, you must "roll" for your desired mutations.\nAll mutations will be reverted if you graft human DNA. This is an effective way of curing all disorders in an emergency or after accidentally using corrupted DNA.</entityname.thal_guidegen_mutation>
	<thal_guidegen_transplantlabel>TRANSPLANTING</thal_guidegen_transplantlabel>
	<entityname.thal_guidegen_transplant>@TRANSPLANTING\n\nTo reduce randomness, an item exists to "hold" selected mutations from the draw.\nThe DNA Transplanter copies, edits, and transfers mutations. Injecting someone with an empty DNA Transplanter will store their mutations if they have any. A sound and a binary effect will occur if the storing is successful, and the stored afflictions will be listed in the mouseover description. Afterward, injecting anyone with the same transplanter will give them all of the stored mutations. Depending on the severity of the mutations, the condition of the transplanter will decrease. More dangerous or beneficial mutations (such as Mutations) typically decrease the condition faster. When the condition reaches zero, the transplanter and its contents are destroyed. This serves as a way to transfer mutations from one person to another, but only a limited number of times.\nThe transfer can also remove certain traits. Equipping the transplanter and pressing "Cull Mutations" allows the contents of the transplanter to be viewed on mouseover, similar to a diving mask or a toolbelt. From here, you can isolate any unwanted mutations in the transplanter. Pressing "Cull Mutations" reduces the transplanter to one use, but you can plant your culled mutations onto a clean subject, and then use a fresh transplanter to scan from said subject.</entityname.thal_guidegen_transplant>
	<thal_guidegen_clonelabel>CLONING</thal_guidegen_clonelabel>
	<entityname.thal_guidegen_clone>@CLONING\n\nIn case your DNA degrades or corrupts, there's a method to retrieve fresh DNA from the corrupted sample through cloning, enabling you to obtain uncorrupted DNA from the original creature.\nTo clone, hold your Biomorphic Incubation Pod in your hands, aim with the right mouse button, and press E or the left mouse button to attach it. Dropping it on the ground will not work. When properly attached, the Incubator will display the amount of "biomass" it contains. Each creature requires a different amount of biomass, with humans requiring 60kg.\nBiomass (organic material) can be obtained by placing fleshy organs from creatures inside the incubator. Geneticists spawn with a Meat Cleaver allowing them to carve meat from corpses to gain biomass. Repeatedly hit corpses until blood gushes everywhere and entrails come out.\nOnce enough biomass is obtained, interact with the Incubator. You will see a single item slot and an initiation button. Place the biomass in the item slot, and it should instantly grind while the counter goes up. Once enough biomass is present, insert the DNA of the desired creature and initiate cloning. You should then be able to scan the creature to obtain uncorrupted DNA.\n\nCongratulations on completing the guide!
